# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe

**Tic-Tac-Toe** is a simple, two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking the grid with either ❌ or ⭕. The objective is to be the first player to place three of your marks in a row—either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. Perfect for quick, casual gameplay! 🤩

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
